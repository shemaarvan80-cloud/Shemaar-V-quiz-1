# Shemaar-V-quiz-1 "I need to build a responsive webpage with a header, a two-column hero section, and a four-column grid. How should I structure my CSS media queries to handle breakpoints for tablet and mobile without using a framework? Please provide a logic plan only, no code." I accepted the idea of using flex-direction: column for the mobile header and using a max-width of 1000px for the main container to keep content readable.Rejected: The AI suggested using a "mobile-first" approach starting at 320px, but I rejected it because the quiz specifically asked to define the desktop styles first and use a max-width: 600px breakpoint for mobile. My hero section isn't stacking on mobile even though I added a media query. Here is my CSS: .hero { display: flex; } @media (max-width: 600px) { .hero { display: block; } }. The hero card is still overlapping the text. How do I fix the alignment?" Response Snippet: "The issue is that display: block doesn't reset flex child alignment effectively. Change the media query to use flex-direction: column; and ensure the hero-card has width: 100% or auto." What I Changed: I updated the .hero class inside the 600px media query to use flex-direction: column and added a margin-top to the card so it didn't touch the text. 375px (Mobile), 768px (Tablet), and 1200px (Desktop).Visual Check: * Confirmed the navigation links center and stack at 375px.Verified the grid switches from 4 columns to 2 columns at 768px.Ensured the hero image stays to the right on 1200px but moves below the text on 375px.
